        "In 2022, we received an overwhelming response from a staggering number of 1401 developers hailing from 100 different countries across the globe. 28.6% of the survey audience reported Solidity as the most used programming language. 🧑‍💻",
        
        "Ethereum's Buterin Floats Prospect of Taking Some Layer-2 Functions Back on Main Chain Vitalik Buterin, a member of the Ethereum Foundation's executive board, once pushed 'layer-2' networks as a way to provide faster and cheaper transactions. Now he's got ideas for 'enshrining' some of those functions on the main chain.",
        
        "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who argued three years ago for pushing more of the blockchain's computational load onto affiliated networks known as 'layer-2 networks' or 'rollups,' has just outlined a plan to take some of the functions back onto the main chain. His idea for an 'enshrined zkEVM' could prove disruptive, since prominent layer-2 projects, including 'ZK-rollups' from Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll, have invested heavily in fulfilling the earlier roadmap. The new networks are already up and running, and the project leaders have been working to recruit developers and already attracted billions of dollars in user deposits.",
        
        "What's left for layer-2 blockchains? Buterin's comments come as ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has lagged behind tokens from rival blockchains as digital-asset markets rallied this year. Ether has climbed by 84%, while Solana's SOL has jumped more than eight-fold in price and Avalanche's AVAX has tripled. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has gained 153%."
