Filmed and edited Sun's YouTube short, to be posted tomorrow for steady stream of content. Synced with Theo P to post [weekly protocol thread](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1732482500482789880?s=20). Reorganized [VoiceAI Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=14u302x6DLZFgUu6-0) for easier navigation & resized icons for perfect alignment.

2023-12-05 Tue: Interacted with community on Twitter regarding [External Leader Rotation](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1732104241790189666?s=20) & [Lend.country launch updates](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1732100733787570227?s=20). Researched golden paths, and filmed 3 videos with Theo's and myself. Edited and [uploaded onto YT shorts](https://youtube.com/shorts/lx7H9UVYNiI?si=0VKs18Lq2je1nNMF). Followed up with eng team regarding ONE Bot '/image --c 3' not working & sent Artem a message about checking reliability of /stats for ONE BOT, considering high activity and low revenue. Sent thinking icon to eng team.

2023-12-04 Mon: Wrote [thread](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1731802936588530006?s=20) recapping engineering updates from Q3. Wrote [Notion schedule](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Weekly-Schedule-d25112943cc845b28ea956206e42a3d7?pvs=4) to improve deadlines and accountability. Wrote [thread](https://x.com/des1gnsoup/status/1731817869032497358?s=20) showcasing my VoiceAI demo and [updated community](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1731852556736090298?s=20) on the launch of Lend. Finalized and reviewed [feedback from Kratos](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-Feedback-92a1bca02faf433c8d1fd71bf8277be3?pvs=4#65f06384d6d04a2787774f75429b8062) on Voice AI.

2023-12-03 Sun: Updated [community section](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Harmony-ONE-211747cea4e240248d941496ee203be8?pvs=4#48bdedabbb904005a4949a4c92b107cd) on harmony.one website, and shared links with TGI group. Retweeted NowNode's [thread (https://x.com/NOWNodes/status/1731670991481286764?s=20). Added more videos to [VoiceAI Demos](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/VoiceAI-Demos-586e43d0cfbc414f94e38b5974104c2a).

2023-12-01 Fri: Synced with NowNodes, helped them to refine copy for a thread they're tweeting next week. Synced with DappRadar about the update to our subscription. Press and Hold was not functional on VoiceAI, so I filmed user tests using solely 'tap to speak'. I was able to film [videos](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/VoiceAI-Demos-586e43d0cfbc414f94e38b5974104c2a?pvs=4) without highlighting 'surprise me' but the responses were still lengthy and subpar. I worked with Theo to draft custom instructions & noticed it's inconvenient to input/delete instructions in the settings. You can't view all the custom instructions and secondly the automatic custom instructions don't autofill after changing. 

2023-11-30 Thu: Wrote thread to promote ONE Bots image to image logo generations, but noticed the feature /image --c 3 was no longer workiing. Forwarded issues to Frank and Yuriy for review. Experimented more golden paths for demos, yet unfortunately the local version of VoiceAI wasn't working on my phone. I wrote scripts to showcase musical history, Harmony knowledge, cooking knowledge, and a language learning version.

2023-11-29 Wed: Wrote [Twitter thread](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1729942794612150510?s=20) promoting 'More Actions'. Filmed demos for Youtube shorts, but noticed VoiceAI was still not working on my iPhone11. Sent all my demos to eng team to understand the bugs. I attempted to record one in Spanish, but Apple's text to speech did not provide an impressive response. Installed local version on my iPhone & continued testing. 

2023-11-28 Tue: Resolving image to image issues on ONE Bot with engineering team, ONE Bot was auto refunding payments. Wrote a twitter thread on image to image generation that will be published following the fix. Did a user testing session with Rika, found that users would appreciate if ONE Bot could teach them how to use the app. Currently, the app says it can handle tasks like "managing calendars and setting reminders" which isn't true. 

2023-11-27 Mon: Worked with Theo P to test ['golden paths' for YT shorts](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Voice-AI-Demo-Questions-276e9075c0904d4997c6645557d1b10b?pvs=4). VoiceAI was glitchy, not responding to queries, responding with irrelevant answers, making it difficult to film a cohesive short. Questions about Harmony protocol were also incorrect, tap to speak was delayed. I'm considering my older iphone may be causing issues, so I will refilm on my iPad.

-----

2023-11-25 Sun: User tested VoiceAI with friends, who found it useful for practicing pitching services to clients. Demoed more image generetaion in One Bot Love. Updated more Substack titles to read more interestingly, such as [the HIP 30v2 article](https://blog.harmony.one/p/hip30v2-update-announcement) and [Q3 Engineering Report](https://blog.harmony.one/publish/posts/detail/138024346/share-center).

2023-11-24 Fri: Updated harmony.one community section. Rewriting Substack titles to be more click-worthy, specific, and informative. Updated [iphone/ipad mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=466%3A267&mode=design&t=QGGUGbxEsXLbhziu-1) for app store and uploaded to App Store Connect for next version release.

2023-11-23 Thu: Thanksgiving Holiday

2023-11-22 Wed: Synced with Theo on VoiceAI feature updates, selected new icon for 'More Actions' command. Integrated the icon into a [new vertical mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=454%3A2&mode=design&t=VHD9TygMOBGw9GNr-1). Shared Thanksgiving based promotions with Harmony community on Telegram and on ONE Bot love. User tested Voice AI with my family.

2023-11-21 Tue: PTO

2023-11-20 Mon: Remade and uploaded iPad app store screenshots, resolved blurry press to speak icon. Corresponded with Kratos & sent a questionaire about his user feedback for VoiceAI. Synced with Theo P on Thanksgiving marketing efforts, generated some [posts](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#69f5fda9ce534b07ac8f6b38c490fdac) in DALLE3, which still need refining.

-----

2023-11-19 Sun: Animated a graphic with mockups for twitter. Wrote & tweeted 2 threads: A user guide [thread](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1726409136328544438?s=20) & a [thread](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1726411171694317894?s=20) answering "How does VoiceAI compare to whisper?". Sent a message to the Harmony community on telegram promoting VoiceAI's launch. Tested VoiceAI & noticed font color changes (looks lighter than it's supposed to be) and also noticed the "Tap to Speak" button is a different color than the Press and Hold. Messaged Frank to correct these issues.

2023-11-17 Fri: Generated [assets](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#b74c48ed794c41bcaea92d226b276052) for VoiceAI on Dalle, in the style of the comic from the Wall St. Journal. I updated the in-app screenshot previews on the app store. Synced with the engineers to fix the circle icon & synced with Rika on the questions and answers about Harmony to be answered by VoiceAI. Addressed the in office storage situation, but decided with Stephen to leave the boxes as is, until we're hosting TGI events again.

2023-11-16 Thu: Spoke with 15 friends and family and onboarded them onto Voice AI, user tested with my sister and boyfriend. Feedback included that they enjoyed the speed of the replies, enjoyed the color scheme, and had fun playing with custom instructions. I animated a graphic for our [Twitter posting](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1725257682117128514?s=20) of the app store launch and wrote a thread promoting the launch. I worked in Photoshop Beta to create more [graphics](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#25a89abf133b444bb620df75cf11009f) for Voice AI.

2023-11-15 Wed: User-tested with Diego. His [feedback](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-Feedback-92a1bca02faf433c8d1fd71bf8277be3?pvs=4#9b149ad9e2b746639f9bcf01efcb6c94) on voice AI was that he enjoyed how our voice catered to his regional accent whereas most voice tools only use standard American accent. He expressed the press to speak button was hard to feel sure Voice AI was listening. He described the buttons 'beeping' feedback was lagging and distracting. He felt you only get feedback that it was listening after you've completed your thought because it beeps 1-2 seconds following your question. I also purchased a storage solution with Amanda to rid our office of boxes & set up a tea subscription. Drafted a series of test questions for Voice AI & experiemented with image to [video generation on Runway](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#70746865c79e4a8681c69f57aed56805).

2023-11-14 Tue: Interviewed Bryan for the tech lead role. Synced with engineers to repair /ask and image generation on ONE Bot, both issues were resolved. Interacted with ONE Bot Love community, sharing image generations with chatgpt prompts. Browsed icon libraries for the Lend logo, noticed most other web3 lending platforms have logos that are completely unrelated to the concept of lending. Merged DALLE 3 generations on Photoshop, to create a [graphic](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#0029afa7ef1b45d5b6ba798b6851897b) that embodies Voice AI use cases... and am continuing to iterate more focusing on the user driving and speaking to their phone vs. using it on a subway during a commute. 

2023-11-13 Mon: Updated harmony.one, adding 'Lend' and removing Defira and updating the community section. Responded to ONE Bot users via Twitter asking how to train their own models. Filmed a screen-recorded demo, but encountered issues as ONE Bot image generation was down. [Cross-posted Voice AI's substack onto Harmony's](https://blog.harmony.one/cp/138847393), another is to be cross posted on Friday. During my testing sessions, Voice AI had to be refreshed because I was able to 'break' it. Spamming buttons & interrupting 'Sam' is how I continually broke it. 

----

2023-11-12 Sun: Synced with Frank to update Voice AI fontface from regular to bold, a change that occured once we implemented the darker background. Created a gif for the [Lend documentation](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Welcome-to-Lend-Docs-739d2643f9a74ee9a4f6672bd43213bf?pvs=4). During testing found that on the "Share with friends" button, the 'sure' and 'cancel' buttons should be flipped. Additionally, I think we can rephrase the pop up to better incentivize users to share it with friends. Simply stating "Share with Friends?" is boring and personally I'd swipe away. Questions like "Are you enjoying this app?" and having the "yes" button lead to sharing and the "no" button lead to feedback is a more engaging way to garner sharing/feedback.

2023-11-10 Fri: Onboarded Diego to Voice AI and scheduled a user interview for 11-15 Wed. Interacted with ONE Bot love community, showing them alternative ways to generate images. They currently really enjoy "/89 *some celebrity* as a Pixar character". Corrected water delivery to our office.

2023-11-09 Thu: Designed vertical/horizontal app store screenshots. Redesigned Voice AI logo with in app colors to replace Voice AI's app logo on the App Store. Had a user interview with Adam on testing Voice AI, his feedback is outlined [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-Feedback-92a1bca02faf433c8d1fd71bf8277be3?pvs=4). Animated a twitter graphic & [tweeted](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1722708040561090765?s=20) to announce $160K volume in swap and new domain of swap.harmony.one

2023-11-08 Wed: [Vectorized Voice AI Logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIu1zfXuCh7JNzQ49oH9ezjHm_TVHEhZ/view?usp=sharing) & drafted first iteration of 'Lend' logo. It's currently a counterpart logo to 'swaps' but will be iterated upon. I animated a notion header for Lend user docs as well. Researched a variety of red colors for our Voice AI logo and found that since there's no centralized naming convention for colors apart from Pantone's, it allows us the opportunity to create a narrative for Voice AI to build our brand identity off of. Synced with Zi, researched Adobe articles, and read through Google/Apple's design guides.

2023-11-07 Tue: Synced with engineers to fix Voice AI UI, created iPad/iPhone 5.5" display screenshots for App Store submission. Finished designing Voice AI [TGI flyer](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1722338925845631126?s=20) & printed at FedEx. Prepped TGI helpers for cooking, set up TGI event, and cleaned up after.

2023-11-06 Mon: Refined [black + red mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=q7kw9s3JibtfgcVK-1) for 6pm implementation. Selected potential icon for new "Say More" button. Began drafting comic to be used on our flyer for TGI tomorrow. Created iPad mocks for App store submission.

---

2023-11-05 Sun: Selected 'thinking icon'. Created [mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WCpvfpe3okxLLfio-1) with red/white/gray icons, I find red too overbearing so I prefer the white/gray icons. Experimented with a red & blue highlight, to be A/B tested with team. I rearranged icons, per my sync with Stephen, to improve  usability while the app is horizontal. I experimented with the icon changes suggested, like having the play and pause icons together and found it to be too busy. Having the icons alternate when the app is paused/played will not only create less busy design, but will give the user proper feedback to know if the session is paused/in play.

2023-11-04 Sat: Read Apple's [directory](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode) for designing in Dark Mode, explored their icon library for audio related icons to implement. Experimenting with styles [here](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WCpvfpe3okxLLfio-1). Aided Theo in getting Testflight access codes & ordered all supplies (lights + blankets) for TGI.

2023-11-03 Fri: Updated Soph's substack article to reflect the latest custodians. Tested custom instructions on Whisper, found success with [these instructions](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/custom-instructions-12c4d7691c584b49b098de1a10df8654), these custom instructions double as a 'user manual' to teach users how to use the app. Explored patio lighting options for our Tuesday TGI & discussed implementing "dark mode" elements into our voice AI interface.

2023-11-02 Thu: Drafted 'dark mode' mocks with HER red highlights. Synced with Frank on 'pixel perfect mocks Worked with Theo to create 30 testing codes for our AI event. 

2023-11-01 Wed: Created wallpapers for thursday event showcasing x.country/voice ai. Mocked up red versions for voice AI app. Synced with Theo on team ChatGPT acccount and a logo for 'Lend'.

2023-10-31 Tue: Tested variety of custom instructions to override "As an AI" "As of my last update" etc. Failed to consistently have Whisper omit the phrases... all quantitative questions 'ie: What is the fed interest rate? Whats the avg rental price in SF' disregarded custom instructions & redirected me to 'up to date' information. Qualitative questions "Who is the most famous soccer player" listened to custom instructions. Posted on Reddit for further advice. Synced with Amanda/Theo to set team up on ChatGPT Premium 

2023-10-30 Mon: Contacted the remote team & utilized Calendly to schedule user testing calls. Synced with remote team on steps to take prior to our call. Prepared topics of discussion for testing. Spent 30 mins on Whisper and 15 on VoiceAI, feedback can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Alaina-fb16535018a34835a8346b74f64e1c56). Aided Rikako in onboarding, synced with Theo on Thursday's event.
