2023-10-25 Fri: Worked on draft of delegating unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing for Voice AI with Sun ([doc](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Kanban-2aff109a6221488081bb99c0d2470d91?p=25ebd29796fe4848b8835b11828b83d1&pm=s)). I expired all previous builds and deployed 0.8.2 build with proper versioning and provided notes for updates regarding the 9am build version 0.8.2. Theo and I will be collecting feedback for daily testing of whisper app and voice ai app ([doc](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Kanban-2aff109a6221488081bb99c0d2470d91?p=56121e87272843bab0bfe2ead2f57bd8&pm=s)).

2023-10-24 Thu: Conducted 15 minutes testing of Whipser App and Voice AI App, left comments [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Fandrich-caf2da5319354c31bf686efa20127744). Produced [cost analysis model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s_QkGFYi07__PxPGLIUeIrAB_ZyONa2iq9kpWhF-M-0/edit#gid=0) to quickly analyze price per minute for different language models and voice models.

2023-10-23 Wed: iOS 16 support will be available by Thursday 10/26, and we should have our own apple support development account available upon Apple's approval so we can deploy our first app for wider testing. Left new tasks for bugs discovered, specifically for handling outstanding network responses overlapping with new user requests ("random fact", "press to talk").

2023-10-22 Tue: We are on our way to having a 5-min functional demo by Friday. Some of the current tasks/bugs/fixes that are underway: Custom Instruction implementations through system settings, streaming audio with chatGPT4 and built in iphone audio synthesis, haptic feedback for improved user experience, and makeover for all buttons. Unit testing and linter will be implemented in the next 7 days as well to streamline and optimize the output of production code.

2023-10-22 Mon: Preparing Frank, Sergey, and Artem's apps for full end to end deploy which should be ready by 9am Tueday morning. Alaina and I will work to prepare a blog post for 1bot.

2023-10-21 Sun: Deployed xCode build for Hey Anne and reconfigured so that all naming conventions matched. I uppdated the temporary logo, openAI API key, and documented how and where to create Appconfig folder [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Help-d3df4ffd40fc46a1abe77e598a8a195e).

2023-10-20 Sat: Worked on debugging xCode build with Sergey, Nagesh, and Aaron to completed end to end build for Hey Eve. Communicated [/press-build](https://www.x.country/voice-ai-talk-to-chatgpt4-as-your-subject-professor-language-buddy-or-streaming-wikipedian-9525f3738a9f405f9238d1e79dab1dd2) to Nagesh who said he can have it complete by Monday.

2023-10-19 Fri: Worked with Frank on group whitelist, tested, and will deploy Friday 7pm. Coordinated with Aaron and Julia to document how to deploy current fission labs fork to testflight app. Organized future tasks on [kanban](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Kanban-2aff109a6221488081bb99c0d2470d91) for ios "streaming build" which artem & sergey, and edge build, which Nagesh from Fission labs is working on.

2023-10-18 Thu: Will work with Sun/Yuriy tomorrow to help set up and benchmark Play.ht, Google, Azure tomorrow [here](https://yuriy.x.country/). Will work with Aaron, Julia, Nagesh, and Sergey to push out several IOS demos in the coming days. Will work with artem on his [demo](artem.x.country), to optimize stream handeling of chatGPT and both speech-to-text module and text-to-speech module.

2023-10-18 Wed: Developed executable steps for engineers. Researched more SST, worked with Sun on benchmarking. Helped set up email aliases. Connected with a few folks at AI voice event. Yuriy is implementing Play.ht's fast new TTS.

2023-10-17 Tue: Read more, wrote more, and organized more. Continued to test sam.x.country and artem.x.country and spent 30 minutes playing with new openAI chat. Communicated to devs new builds and worked through determing how to execute new features and remove bugs.

2023-10-16 Mon: Throughouly tested artem.x.country (currently a bug where there is no audio in production). Interruptions has been implemented and chatGPT4 context has been integrated. Next steps is to more seemlessly handle streaming and handle bugs. Tested yuriy.x.country (credentials need to be set up).
