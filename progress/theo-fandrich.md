1. **Blockchain Research and Integration:**
    - Conduct comprehensive research on AI and infrastructure-focused blockchains such as Near, Tao, Render, Fetch, and Akash. Identify unique mechanisms, innovative products, and groundbreaking ideas that can be adapted and built upon Harmony's platform. The objective is to leverage these insights to enhance Harmony's AI capabilities and infrastructure, particularly focusing on how these platforms facilitate AGI and social AI integration, ensuring Harmony remains at the forefront of blockchain technology and AI convergence.
2. **Competitive Landscape Analysis in AGI and Social AI:**
    - Undertake a thorough analysis of competitor products and platforms within the AGI and Social AI space, particularly those building within similar ecosystems. This goal aims to benchmark Harmony's current offerings against the market, identify gaps and opportunities for innovation, and strategize on unique value propositions that can be introduced to differentiate and elevate Harmony's position in the market.
3. **ONE Map and h.country Integration Enhancement:**
    - Complete the integration of ONE map, including a comprehensive database and social graph integration with h.country. This initiative should focus on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience that leverages location-based services to foster social interactions, enhance community engagement, and provide utility in a manner that uniquely combines geographical data with blockchain technology.
4. **Deployment of Lazarus Liquid Staking on Babylon POS:**
    - Deploy Lazarus liquid staking on Babylon Proof of Stake (POS) staking for Bitcoin. This goal focuses on enhancing the staking mechanisms within Harmony's ecosystem, providing users with more flexible and efficient staking options. It aims to leverage the security and efficiency of Babylon POS staking to introduce innovative staking solutions that attract more participants to the ecosystem, thereby strengthening the network and increasing its utility.
5. **Farcaster Frames and Premium .country Domains Feature Development:**
    - Define and prioritize the next set of features for integration into the Farcaster Frames and premium .country domains, with a particular emphasis on enhancing user engagement and utility. This goal involves deep collaboration with users and stakeholders to identify features that drive social bonding, engagement, and utility. Explore innovative ways to use AI, social graphs, and blockchain technology to create more personalized, engaging, and valuable user experiences. The aim is to make Farcaster Frames and .country domains central to users' daily digital interactions, fostering a sense of community and belonging.
6. **AI-Driven Social Engagement Innovations:**
    - Develop and prototype new AI-driven features and services that promote social engagement and interaction within Harmony's ecosystem. This could include personalized AI chatbots for community support, AI-curated content for user education and engagement, and machine learning algorithms to enhance the social graph's connectivity and relevance. The goal is to leverage AI not just as a technological tool but as a means to deepen human connections, foster social interactions, and create a more engaging and supportive community ecosystem.

2024-02-11 — 2024-02-23: I focused on enhancing our main project, One Map, and addressing aspects of another project, h.country. I devoted significant time to product testing, bug tracking, and implementing crucial formatting updates for One Map. I helped set up API keys and manage dev accounts. We gained app store approval for ONE map and I continued to submit updates as we fixed and changed app interface. Development for hot reload for React Native as well as firebase integration is underway.

Simultaneously, I delved into blockchain technologies, investigating Layer 1 solutions like Sui, Solana, Cardano, ICP, and Celestia. My research sharpened insights into throughput and latency challenge, while also exploring advancements like zero-knowledge proofs and Optimistic Rollups. Despite the high throughput of platforms like Solana and Sui, a unified product vision is absent. Only one project possessed a grounded vision of 'blockchain singularity,' with the R&D capabilities to execute.
