2023-11-16 Thu: The app's recall has shown noticeable improvements, and it seems that the "Surprise Me!" feature no longer prompts the start of a new session. However, the longer you speak with the app the more the recall weakens. 

I requested the app to craft a grocery list with specific details, after discussing various topics and revisiting the list a few minutes later, the app initially recalled the items in their precise initial order. As our conversation continued and I circled back to the grocery list, it no longer maintained the correct order and eventually presented an entirely different list instead of recalling the original one.

2023-11-15 Wed: The integration of picture-in-picture functionality within this app would significantly enhance its utility for me. Adding picture-in-picture lets you multitask visually while using voice commands, making it easy to access info without interrupting your flow.

The 'Surprise Me' topics sometimes feel mundane; incorporating conversation data to tailor these suggestions would enhance their relevance and engagement. When it comes to prompting creative responses, the app demonstrates effective variability.

I inquired about the top healthiest fish, and the app initially ranked salmon as number one, later in the ranking I interrupted to ask the app to repeat what number two on the list was. When prompted to identify the second-ranked fish, the app continued to mention salmon as number two and eventually admitted it couldn't recall the specifics of our conversation.

 Deciding to focus on the recall capabilities, I inquired with the app about our initial conversation, and it started discussing a topic not previously covered in this session or any prior sessions. Additionally, I notice a delay in response consistently when using the "Surprise Me!" function.

I initiated the session by discussing Las Vegas tourist attractions, followed by a "Surprise Me!" function. However, when asked about our initial conversation, the app only recalled the fun facts it shared, not the session's starting information. 

I attempted to pause the app while it was sharing a fun fact, but it didn't respond immediately; I had to press the pause button again. Inconsistencies in voice recognition and delayed responses are occasional issues with the app.

I've noticed that there are instances where I need to repeat my question to prompt a response from the app. In a particular interaction, I asked the app to list the top five restaurants in an area. At the end of the list, when I inquired about the fourth restaurant, I had to ask multiple times before the app eventually referred to the correct entry. In the same session, after discussing various topics and referencing that part of the conversation, the app did not repeat the correct information that I requested. 

In another instance, when I asked about the pricing at a botanical garden, the app provided the information but mentioned it might not be up to date. When I inquired about the latest year of data, the app avoided answering the question. Additionally, when the app referenced a restaurant's website during our conversation, and I asked for the website, it simply advised me to perform a Google search with the restaurant's name and 'official website'.

The app provided a long detailed response to one of my questions, prompting me to request a quicker listing of names. Although it complied promptly, I had to ask the app to slow down two separate times and spell out the names twice for clarity. I find response time and rate of speech to be fairly inconsistent. 

2023-11-08 Wed:
I experienced delays in response, and the voice doesn't quite meet my preferences. Consider categorizing fun facts based on user interests for a more personalized experience, using data from the current conversation. Additionally, it would enhance user convenience if the user guide were presented as a pop-up within the app rather than linking to an external webpage. I came across a bug where I had to hold the 'Surprise ME!' button. Additionally, there's a suggestion to consider changing all buttons to lowercase to align with current trends. When I inquired about Los Angeles, the assistant responded appropriately, but when I asked for more details about places to visit, I received the exact same lengthy response. On a positive note, the 'New Session' button works seamlessly.

2023-11-07 Tue:
While using the app, I often find myself wishing for the ability to engage with it in a hands-free manner. The allure of a speech-driven application lies in its effortless operation, allowing for a more natural conversation and the ability to use the app while engaged in other activities like washing dishes or driving. It would be convenient not to require pressing and holding a button to speak.

2023-11-06 Mon:
I envision using this app primarily for planning and brainstorming, be it for meal preparation, travel itineraries, or daily routines. Nevertheless, a significant drawback lies in its inability to deliver real-time data like traffic updates, weather forecasts, current time, and the most precise and up-to-date information on restaurants, stores, and other establishments.

The app has an elegant and uncomplicated design. While the 'random fact' feature may not need to take center stage, incorporating a small text box for easy copying and pasting of relevant information would be a valuable addition. The app excels in its user-friendly interface. Furthermore, introducing diverse voice options, similar to those found in map applications, would be a noteworthy improvement.

2023-11-02 Thu:
I used the app to explore various dinner options. I appreciated the convenience of engaging in a conversation rather than sifting through online recipes. The app offered simple yet tailored meal suggestions based on my dietary preferences and additional queries. I also used the app to plan out a week's worth of meals. I can see myself making regular use of this app for brainstorming and meals. One minor issue I encountered was occasional delays in response when asking a direct question, requiring me to re-prompt the app.

It would enhance convenience if there were an option for a text pop-up when specific questions are asked, like 'create a grocery list.' This way, users wouldn't have to manually transcribe the request, making it as simple as copy and paste. I found the app's initial use to be straightforward, though its emphasis on mega-minimalism might be initially surprising for some, but likely easy to adapt to. Consider enlarging the main functions, such as 'speak,' 'pause,' and 'repeat,' for better accessibility, while keeping the less frequently used functions smaller.
