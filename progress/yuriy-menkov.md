2023-10-10 Tue: [Completed](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/4) - Added tts audio player, integrated with elevenlabs (rest) and gpt streams, integrated with Artem's PR's. Code refactoring. Started work on UI improvements.

2023-10-09 Mon: I tried different options for working with TTS Elevenlabs (rest, ws), tried different sentence breakdowns. At the moment, we managed to achieve requests of 1.3 seconds for each sentences from the chatgpt stream. Also the current tts engine has many problems and often audio tracks overlap each other - a player is needed to manage them. Then i started working on the adding the tts audio player to project (smart management of audio chunks), and its integration with the chatgpt and elevenlabs stream [Worked](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/4)
