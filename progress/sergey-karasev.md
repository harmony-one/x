I worked on [yak benchmark](https://github.com/harmony-one/yakGPT/commit/8e078135f420fd51a1d4b4e021102b13e8e352c8), Ñ‹ince the code is nonlinear, I have added metrics to the console log for now and I am continuing to work on the metrics in order to display them on the page.

I worked on a mobile application for iOS. I set up the development environment and created a [project](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/75e49d6dda803119b224bbc3ccacc68d6fa68b7a). I studied how to work with the microphone in React Native. I also [configured Yak GPT and published it](https://yak-gpt.fly.dev/).

I explored the Telegram API call and Twilio for technical limitations and the possibility of integrating with streaming audio and integration with GPT-4. And also started working on a mobile application.
