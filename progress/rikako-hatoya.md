1. Native App / Open Source
Full-stack engineering is my strongest suit, as I work on building mobile apps using React Native through my current job. We are building a contact sharing app and have implemented features such as user dashboard and background location tracking to detect and display where contacts were added. I have also worked solo on a months-long personal project where I built an open source event sharing social media app using Google Cloud Platform and released it publicly on Expo.

2. Applied Mathematics / Optimization
During my graduate studies, I took courses on large scale data mining/complex networks, reinforcement learning, and optimization through linear programming. I utilized this knowledge while working on multiple Kaggle competition projects, as well as my research in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Here I focused on transfer learning, applying clustering methods, and generating synthetic data to improve the quality of classification. I was also part of a mathematics olympiad team during undergrad, where I achieved a high score at the Putnam Mathematical Competition.

3. Parallelism
During my research internship at Caltech, I was part of a group called the LIGO collaboration where I developed our open-source Python library to classify different types of astronomical signals collected by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors. Our signals had strain dimensions of 10^-18, making it very difficult to detect our signals underlying in variant noise sources. To do this, we built a Python library and used ML to predict the types of signals. My task was to improve the classification accuracy of this library. I built a Python program to simulate variants of different astronomical signals, and then built a parallel program to simulate these signals at a large-scale in a significantly reduced amount of time. Each simulation cost approximately 1 minute and nearly 10,000 signals were simulated in an hour, reducing the time complexity by more than 99%.
