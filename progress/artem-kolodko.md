2023-10-13 Fri: [Added](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/d91d171430ffa976d71677b27da95cf1a6d7719e) full Deepgram Nova 2 support in speech-to-text module; [improved](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/dccc64b51dbefd5fef8072bf40839387f2ad575d) interaction with GPT4: speech-to-text module collects chunks of a text and sends them to gpt4 after a delay of 1.5 seconds.

2023-10-12 Thu: Deepgram Nova 2: researched official [docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio), tested Nova 2 with stream support with a test script. Created simple relayer service to keep secrets on backend, [working](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/13) on the X webapp integration with Nova 2 API.

2023-10-11 Wed: [Implemented](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/9/files) sending an STT result to GPT4 by user command. Improved STT chunks parsing and overall UX.

2023-10-10 Tue: Picovoice STT doesn't work very well with text recognition. Checked other models: Speechmatics, Google, RevAI, [added](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/3) Speechmatics streaming STT and started testing.

2023-10-09 Mon: [Worked](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/a4fd48bbb15be869618a14c02d6f909f3c89d314) on improving X app UI. [Added](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/8977ce4739d34df8fecf1a8d956654786a7023c5) start-stop STT.
