2024-01-21 Sun: Simplifying Minimal Quest Lottery for Yuriy and Artem.

2024-01-20 Sat: Research and testing for solana inscriptions. Insights: strong nft community from solana is what is carrying inscriptions, some token generations as well but nothing yet in terms of strong utility. Main tool, [LiberPlex](https://www.libreplex.io/) lacking in quality, UI/UX. Main volume from Tensor and MagicEden. 

2024-01-19 Fri: Early morning on-call assisting with mint. SQL analytics for onescription mint. Ecosystem lottery implementation discussions. Further inscription plans and personnel allocation for 2024 roadmap tasks.

2024-01-18 Thu: Prototyped pool-based flip architecture for optimized liquidity and decentralization with Julia.  

2024-01-17 Wed: Technical calls with partners. Speaker for [twitter space with Gateway X](https://x.com/GatewayX_one/status/1747825674524704880?s=20).

2024-01-16 Tue: Launch plan and coordination with internal team and external partners. Continued development for [inscription tools](https://hmy-inscription.web.app/) and eventually [i.country](https://i.country).

2024-01-15 Mon: Federal Holiday

---

2024-01-14 Sun: EthDenver content for applications.

2024-01-13 Sat: Flip custodians allocation and discussions.

2024-01-12 Fri: Released 2024 roadmap and twitter threads.

2024-01-11 Thu: Completed Roadmap 2024, ready for substack release. 

2024-01-10 Wed: Completed successful OneBitFlip proof-of-concept with Julia. Inscribed x.1 and 1.country. Reached out to potential Flip custodians. iOS Safe Multisig development underway.

2024-01-09 Tue: Ran Tuesday Dev call, sync for prioritization, native USDC (Base) and ONE (Harmony) swap or “flip” as it contains no smart contract signing or bridging will be the first release. Completed a draft of 2024 announcement and site copy for USDC/ONE flip. Coded template for 1bot landing page, helped Alaina with walkthrough guide.

2024-01-08 Mon: Roadmapping and interview session with Stephen. Participated in HER space #13.

2024-01-07 Sun: Added metablox to Dapp Overview. Deep dive for Thorchain and Chainflip. Insight: Still early for chainflip, but JIT AMM (Just-in-time automated market maker) currently has the edge on the technical side for capital efficiency. Thorchain currently has millions more in liquidity and volume, chainflip is only just starting having released [pre-release swaps](https://x.com/Chainflip/status/1736796878807683141?s=20) 2 weeks ago ($1k USD single swap limit). Heavy fee hit on BTC, best for larger swaps.

2024-01-06 Sat: Updated dapp overview, curated list of active validators, sync with knights&peasants for giveaway. Reviewed delphi digital "year in review" reports.

2024-01-05 Fri: Synced with Casey for recovery and lend. Coordinated with custodians for [Round 15](https://x.com/recoveryonefdn/status/1743515190463791354?s=20).

2024-01-04 Thu: Granted access to gnosis group, awaiting response for official integration update. No respponse from Dune, current best option is [data request](https://feedback.dune.com/data-request/p/add-support-for-harmony-protocol).

2024-01-03 Wed: Reached out for Dune listing on [data request form](https://feedback.dune.com/data-request/p/add-support-for-harmony-protocol), discord, and support email. AAG admins figuring out bridge tvl inquiry. Waiting on gnosis contact for official listing. Continued Dapp overview updates and project outreach.

2024-01-02 Tue: Added Knights & Peasants to dapp overview. Handed-off [CreateX deploy](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx) issue to Casey. Continued research on Anoma, key insight: heavy burden on author of intents. Anoma and other "intent-centric" projects depend on either quality intents, or the quality of the handling of those intents. Most immediate valuable use case: [Multi-Party Bartering](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/wtf-is-anoma-part-1-wtf-are-intents#intents-arent-just-limit-orders-e458). 

2024-01-01 Mon: Reviewed Galaxii and updated dapp overview. More testing of uniswap x, centralization risk with more than 70% of fill orders coming from Wintermute or Tokka Labs.

2023-12-31 Sun: Tested Uniswap X. Key insights: Best suited for high liquidity swaps. Most swaps under $10k do not benefit from the gas-free transactions. Uniswap X routing favors trading pairs with significant volume and liquidity. Maximum Extractable Value [(MEV) protection](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/front-running) through their [Dutch Limit Order Reactor](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Uniswap-X-2ebfe67b5ccc4c44a7b704f1376c457e?pvs=4), combined with "[fillers](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/uniswapx/guides/createfiller)" covering the gas fee, makes Uniswap X optimal for general, high-liquidity swapping and less effective for MEV traders.

2023-12-30 Sat: Tested Multibit bridge, bridged $MUBI (ERC-20) very clean UI/UX and smooth transfer. Unknown technicals and poses a risk. Also, 0.03 ETH service fee is quite high.

2023-12-29 Fri: Joined telegram groups and conducted market research for [MultiBit](https://multibit.exchange/) and [Ordizk](https://ordizk.io/) for BRC-20 to EVM bridges, will test over the weekend. Initial thoughts: both look promising in what they say they can deliver but their telegram groups, lack of public repos, and lack of technical information is worrisome.

2023-12-28 Thu: Completed initial [Harmony Dapp Overview](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Dapp-Overview-fc7a6a82e65540278d3e2951e0262398?pvs=4), drafting tweet to share with community. Used phantom wallet to test and research top wallets, will move to open source to see if anything is comparable.

2023-12-27 Wed: Started initial [Harmony Dapp Overview](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Dapp-Overview-fc7a6a82e65540278d3e2951e0262398?pvs=4), will continue to add more tomorrow. 

2023-12-26 Tue: Spoke with Eugene from marscolony about nft marketplace following nftkey's dissolution. Completed review of Avalanche specific inscriptions "avascriptions" compared to the greater space. Still not seeing much in the inscription ultility department but more may come later. Today, 3.4m transactions came solely from an inscription token called "ShenLong" with a 1 mint token limit per transaction. Wary of connecting directly to avascriptions.com but minting directly should be much safer by design of inscriptions (no smart contract signatores needed).

2023-12-25 Mon: Christmas

---

2023-12-24 Sun: Researched different Ordinals projects, joined a free mint for [bitblocks](https://twitter.com/billyrestey) from twitter user "billy". DeFi wave for bitcoin that may follow the memes and brc-20 craze will be interesting to watch. Phantom and other dapps/wallets as well as exchanges like [OKX](https://www.okx.com/web3/hot/inscription) are preparring themselves well for an increase in bitcoin adoption.

2023-12-23 Sat: Joined Ethereum, Polygon, Degen, AI, and Arbitrum channels on warpcast. Ethereum has the largest community out of all of them by quite some margin (16k members, closest is AI with ~4k). Insight for today: Quility UI/UX posts explaining the need for simplicity in the web3 space, more is not always better. 

2023-12-22 Fri: Joined warpcast. Read through inscription posts as well. Warpcast community still wondering about the utility for inscriptions outside of bitcoin. Room for more inscription use cases on evm chains, must be more than memetic oriented for sustained adoption.

2023-12-21 Thu: Posted instcriptions guide on [X](https://x.com/theoperisic/status/1737359794963677462?s=20). Completed NFT [analysis between Moonbirdgs and PudgeyPenguins](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Pudgy-Penguins-vs-MoonBirds-1c8f2ec1bcf5436e83cbf9b4526e56e0?pvs=4), interesting proof of concept that shows "community > product" in web3 business models.

2023-12-20 Wed: Looked over Casey's announcement forum post. Spent today at investors lunch with Stephen. Interesting insights in gamefi coming soon and early alpha on first playstation web3 game. Intersection of crypto and AI still a valuable opportunity. 

2023-12-19 Tue: Continued work with Inscriptions. Completed [image inscriptions guide](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Inscription-Process-e3e43a20835c4a3b88cb5d8f22f9b784?pvs=4). Successful inscription using CLI on Sun’s build, waiting for pull request merge for main build.

2023-12-18 Mon: Experimenting with inscriptions on Harmony. Created an [image inscription](https://explorer.harmony.one/tx/0xba7fa5573ad86a69fb980c228d7297c361e3b99b5f56a6ec8ae328aa0f299d89) using metamask and text based json as well. Completed [general analysis](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Inscriptions-f16f5cb08c054cc688ace7673698a4a1?pvs=4) of non-bitcoin inscription projects.

---

2023-12-17 Sun: Catching up on messages and team updates, will continue on Monday. Reached out to metamask contact for metamask portfolio listing.

2023-12-16 Sat: Showcased Voice AI app for group of 10, insights: I downloaded most recent version of the app and without internal context I found it to be very confusing to navigate and showcase to people. The app has also taken a turn to becoming overcomplicated. Current structure is a generalized application of openai’s gpt 4 that allows a single app to satisfy many different use cases, an alternative approach may be to highly specialize the app for a single use case.

2023-12-11 Mon - 2023-12-15 Fri: Paid time off

---

2023-12-10 Sun: General Harmony overview and communications with the community.

2023-12-09 Sat: App testing, insight: noticed I most frequently use the app for a quick inquiry about a fact or interesting information that is lacking in a moment or a conversation. Using the additional feature of “Surprise Me!” far less. 

2023-12-08 Fri: v1.1208.18 (Updated transcript logs) Mapped full perceived latency benchmarks using [Aaron’s docs](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/blob/main/doc/benchmarking.md), synced with Yuriy for implementation.

2023-12-07 Thu: v1.1207.18 (TimeLogger improvements) Detailed potential focus split for 2024 project roadmap.

2023-12-06 Wed: v1.1206.18 (10MB limit for sharing transcription, “Pause/Play” font alignment and icons update). Updated quickfacts custom instruction [#322](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/322). Reviewed Sudoswap amm nft platform. [Tweeted](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1732482500482789880?s=20) weekly protocol updates. 

2023-12-05 Tue: v1.1205.18 (Improved haptic feedback for “Press & Hold”). Worked with Alaina for the social media videos.

2023-12-04 Mon: v1.1204.18 (iPhone 15 Action Button support for "Surprise Me!", check implemented for empty "Surprise Me!" result). Completed new x code review.

---

2023-12-03 Sun: Extensive review of x codebase.

2023-12-02 Sat: General app testing of latest version. Key insight: "Hey" loses personalization of the app that might draw user back in. Suggested implementation: Additional to "System Settings" or "Custom Instructions", "User Profile" where the user describes themselves and it is added to the context. 

2023-12-01 Fri: Deployed 1.1201.18 (Updated action sheets, iPad misconfiguration resolved). Created script for finding “[canned responses](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Canned-Responses-08c2a748e67b4da0bf8c05c817c17911?pvs=4)” throughout codebase. 

2023-11-30 Thu: Deployed 1.1130.18 (Context increase 500 -> 8000, Language support now 183). Continued testing smaller models, Mistral and Llama 7b via Ollama. Insights: Llama 7b more verbose but unreliable. Mistral much more consistent at following instructions and fast outputs. GPT-3.5 still the clear winner, but for on-device efficiency and cost optimization, Mistral seems best suited.

2023-11-29 Wed: Deployed 1.1129.18, key change: In-App purchase backend handling improvements. Started [testing Mistral 7b](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Mistral-7b-Testing-4c0512d7106b41ed8321204268d79eb4?pvs=4) locally for upcoming complete on-device build for latency optimization and improved availability. 

2023-11-28 Tue: Deployed 1.1128.18 to TestFlight build, key changes: (Sun) fixed expiration update [bug](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/51c175aaa66b0e460e555d39972b74db1254732a) and (Yuriy) added refactoring [optimization](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/277). Completed set of [3 predefined custom instructions](https://harmonyone.notion.site/3-Predefined-Custom-Instructions-b36546c4ee544aea8168c7f046c476c5?pvs=4).

2023-11-27 Mon: Deployed 1.1127.18 to TestFlight build. Created [Voice AI demo questions](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Voice-AI-Demo-Questions-276e9075c0904d4997c6645557d1b10b?pvs=4) and engineered prompts to output various examples.

---

2023-11-26 Sun: Worked with OpenAIs Assistants API, useful for incorporating our own information, Harmony specific, as well as performing tasks like sending a message or interacting with zappier. Insight: pricing is way too high for the lack of consistency of outputs. Focusing on mastering the quickest smart companion seems to be the best direction at the moment. Potential pivot to smaller LLM to distance from openai and fine tune for use cases specific to a low latency companion needs addressing based on pricing, speed, and dependency on openai.

2023-11-25 Sat: Used the app and thought of different ways to increase user retention. Insight: Hand hold the user to a specific app interaction through a specific button. (Daily Trivia, Cooking Assistant, or Quick Ideation) these use cases must highlight the low latency capabilities of the app as this is the main value proposition at the moment.

2023-11-24 Fri: Following discussions, drafted simple [gamification elements](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Gamification-for-Voice-AI-3ff4489eb71a42649073e2806a2f939c?pvs=4) and options to improve [user retention](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Improving-User-Retention-2f6b2f3c2c47466b82e93f0b92916e79?pvs=4) as active users has dropped significantly.

2023-11-23 Thu: Thanksgiving, user testing for voice ai app with 20 people. App insight: (12) people were impressed with the speed, (17) don’t like the voice, (11) mentioned they would use it in the kitchen if there was a hands-free mode.

2023-11-22 Wed: Deployed 1.1122.18 to TestFlight build. App insight: current app structure is too broad for user retention, internal users are the only users coming back.

2023-11-21 Tue: Deployed 1.1121.18 to Voice 2 build. Added [Thanksgiving marketing copy](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Thanksgiving-Marketing-Campaign-f4e2ff42dd7e4c78946722e4b64244f2?pvs=4) to Alaina’s graphic. Tested processing logic for [Harmony specific information](https://harmonyone.notion.site/HarmonyGPT-b517a68bce564ac68cebd378b5d420e2?pvs=4) without the need of memory.

2023-11-20 Mon: Deployed 1.1120.18 public TestFlight build. Created and added full [Terms](https://x.country/terms), Privacy, and Copyright for Apple Pay build.

---

2023-11-19 Sun: Completed potential [Thanksgiving marketing campaign](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Thanksgiving-Marketing-Campaign-f4e2ff42dd7e4c78946722e4b64244f2?pvs=4).

2023-11-18 Sat: Added and tested [6 scenarios](https://harmonyone.notion.site/AI-Driven-Conversation-d04d358c14ad42d68f35d4799314a838?pvs=4) for AI-driven conversations.

2023-11-17 Fri: We deployed 1.1117.18 public TestFlight build. Completed and tested first draft of [AI-Driven Conversations](https://harmonyone.notion.site/AI-Driven-Conversation-d04d358c14ad42d68f35d4799314a838?pvs=4).

2023-11-16 Thu: Added to OpenAI [review](https://harmonyone.notion.site/OpenAI-Implementation-Review-3a44d85cce504066a8fed5690bbc56ef?pvs=4). Helped Sun with custom instruction issues, documented changes [here](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Custom-Instruction-Framework-a61592bd8937490f9e85d527879d9e20?pvs=4).

2023-11-15 Wed: Completed Harmony quiz [demo](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Quiz-Exmaple-75a999245f544662906d09ad2838c820?pvs=4). Started [OpenAI implementation review](https://harmonyone.notion.site/OpenAI-Implementation-Review-3a44d85cce504066a8fed5690bbc56ef?pvs=4).

Also reviewed other [AI premium app](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Competitor-Analysis-2caebf2a984b485db56e53df08a206bd?pvs=4) payment, insight: subscription plans for 1 week and 1 year are the most common payment schedules offered. 

2023-11-13 Mon: User testing for chunking issue with sun, found Apple's text-to-speech as the cause for the unnatural pausing. Reviewed Fenwick Terms update.

---

2023-11-12 Sun: Reviewed Fenwick Terms of Service, sent comments back for changes.

2023-11-11 Sat: Continued testing Voice AI, currently heavy burden on user to get value out of usage.

2023-11-10 Fri: Completed an initial release usage and [feedback table](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Initial-Release-Usage-and-Feedback-661d427191534b6f9a58e950685e1242?pvs=4) to focus on main blockers to “30 people 30 minutes” goal.

2023-11-09 Thu: Following App Store launch, completed [in-app growth strategies](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Growth-Brainstorm-5a776417f42d4c38923bf541a79df413?pvs=4). Continued [app testing](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Release-Testing-f4c1cc052fc84d999a6ddd8e218fb27a?pvs=4).

2023-11-06 Mon: Completed [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/blob/main/doc/privacy.md) for free and non-tracking build. Meeting with Fenwick for Privacy and Terms for Voice AI, shared required materials with team, full documents ready by end of week. Completed a brief [list of alternatives](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Alternatives-for-Skip-5-seconds-Random-Fact-504a80795e1e4484a086c5620ceeb5ad?pvs=4) for “Skip 5 Seconds” and “Random Fact”.

---

2023-11-05 Sun: Started brainstorming alternatives for "Skip 5 seconds" and "Random Fact" will create a notion on Monday.

2023-11-04 Sat: Conducted tests on the Voice AI app and demonstrated its functionalities to family members.

2023-11-03 Fri: Completed [ideation for improving latency](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Ideas-For-Latency-Optimization-7073ab27465146a4a211c7bc1819c7e2) sourcing from y-combinator, twitter, and github repos.

2023-10-27 Fri: Started development log for version increments [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Kanban-2aff109a6221488081bb99c0d2470d91?p=810178d623804820a8d3b3483a6e6ada&pm=s). Collecting Voice AI internal feedback with Theo.

2023-10-26 Thu: Provided the [updated custom instructions](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Custom-Instructions-2e3ff8d9e9254c039e2d253ad18ec6a1?pvs=4) for Sun to implement in the current Voice AI build. Helped debug [Press Speak recognition issue](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/blob/main/voice/mobile/x/SpeechRecognition/SpeechRecognition.swift) with Sun.

2023-10-25 Wed: Started collecting [in-office feedback](https://harmonyone.notion.site/OpenAI-ChatGPT-Voice-Feedback-b92ec110c57548ff93b99d6227103011?pvs=4) for OpenAI ChatGPT voice mode. Went over [marketing strategy and copy](https://voiceai.substack.com/p/voice-ai-talk-with-chatgpt4-on-apple) with Stephen for Voice AI. Continued testing golden paths and added instructions for [interactive storytelling](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Custom-Instructions-2e3ff8d9e9254c039e2d253ad18ec6a1?pvs=4).

2023-10-24 Tue: Added more promotion options to the [Cost Analysis](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Cost-Analysis-97cd614180164d71a398131a0df545bd?pvs=4) including the 5 minute usage with 10 minute break and 10 sessions per day restrictions.

Iterated on the [App Store Copy](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Voice-AI-Talk-with-ChatGPT4-on-Apple-App-Store-a3dcb50d30654c508779b123d278546f?pvs=4) that will be used for the application process.

---

2023-10-22 Sun: Product testing for Chatgpt, Hey Sam, and [Play.ht's new 2.0 launch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/playht).

2023-10-21 Sat: Coordinated with Aaron for App Manager access for Hey Sam. Added character lengths for each section and useful links for the [application process](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Project-Intro-Product-Details-Screen-Mocks-a3dcb50d30654c508779b123d278546f?pvs=4).

2023-10-20 Fri: Started information compilation for [App Store application process here](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Project-Intro-Product-Details-Screen-Mocks-a3dcb50d30654c508779b123d278546f?pvs=4). Wrote [first draft](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Description-DRAFT-b56cd5582a134ba192de1fd09cc239c2?pvs=4) of App Store description for “Hey Sam”.  Deep dive with Labhesh on Replika and which knowledge models are best to use for getting past OpenAI guardrails. Mistral and Falcon 7b are potential starting points. Additional concerns with opening doors that we should not be opened was mentioned.
