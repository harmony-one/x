2023-10-29 Sun: Cleaning up Yuriy's PR so that "Press to Speak" button is working. Will wrap up tomorrow.

2023-10-28 Sat: Reviewed Yuriy's PR on streaming implementation for OpenAI.

2023-10-27 Fri: Fixed "Press to Speak" so that it does not crash from silence anymore. Bug fix regarding interruption has been fixed, "Press to Speak" in the middle of generation and synthesis is working as expected. There is a known bug where a user rapidly spamming "Press to Speak" button will the audio functionality to crash (will continue working on this). ChatGPT4 context has been enabled.

2023-10-26 Thu: Redeployed with another bug fix where "Press to Speak" button ends only when user lets go of the hold (previously 1.5 second silence would stop the recording). Implemented interruptibility where recognition task and audio response now stops when user holds the "Press to Speak" button, starting a new recognition task. Implemented OpenAI call with custom instruction embedded.


2023-10-25 Wed: Fixed another bug preventing "Press to Speak" button from working. Fixed the bug and refactored code so that any layout and / or design change will be separated from the logic implementation. Began implementing OpenAI streaming functionality based on Aaron's build.

2023-10-24 Tue: Fixed a bug preventing "Press Speak" button on the press build from working. Deployed the fix on "Voice AI" and "Sun". Began polishing the repo so that it is production ready. Will implement CI/CD pipeline, add linting rules, and other components that will make the repo more robust.

2023-10-23 Mon: Wrapped up user perceived latency for web app which is 15%, 45%, and 40% for transcription, knowledge base, and synthesis respectively (Deepgram, GPT4, and Azure / Google). I also deployed "sun" as a fork of FissionLab's Voice AI. There are many bugs to fix, mainly "Speak" button not working, and I will continue on fixing the bugs with Julia tomorrow. I have also set up another machine for Ivan to test out multiple LLM models.

2023-10-22 Sun: Measured latencies for Google. Can test out the latencies [here](https://yuriy.x.country/). Continued studying xcode to participate in iOS development and measure latencies.

2023-10-19 Thu: Continued working on calculating individual latencies for the API to use. Tested Azure, Google, and began to a look at Play.ht.

2023-10-18 Wed: Calculated end to end and user perceived latencies for sam.x.country. This [document](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/API-Percentage-b44ce9c347f5474fb0f0a36c02dc6e55?pvs=4) contains detailed information. Started learning Xcode in order to benchmark and make improvements to ths X iOS application.

2023-10-17 Tue: Benchmarked latencies for various speech to text API. Deepgram [outperforms](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/API-Benchmark-f3bee005a3aa4e4eb302ad02647a3d8b?pvs=4) others by far. Fixed ElevenLabs issue "webapp" was having. Had a meeting with Ivan to prioritize tasks, we will work on benchmarking latency percentage for the end-to-end flow.

2023-10-16 Mon: Updated the app to support iOS compatibility on Safari, which will become the main browser for /sam. Began setting up Prometheus to measure time lapsed on key components of the app (DeepGram, ChatGPT, and ElevenLabs).

2023-10-13 Fri: Deployed voice-webapp on [sun.x.country](sun.x.country). Working on integrating with Ivan's Acapela to the voice-webapp. Looking for various areas of optimization.

2023-10-12 Thu: Studying and going over Hugging Face [Quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization); Wrestling [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17323.pdf) paper (still need time to fully digest the material); Building demo 8-bit GTPQ (referenced from this [repo](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/gptq)); will continue working on this tomorrow

2023-10-11 Wed: Set up access and permission to supercomputing infrastructure with GPUs (for Ivan); Set up access and permission to Picovoice Rhino benchmark testing; Benchmarked the following NLU models: Picovoice Rhino, Google Dialogflow, Amazon Lex; Picovoice Rhino outperforms the other mentioned models by ~30% average
