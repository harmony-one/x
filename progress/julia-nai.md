2023-10-17 Tue: Built a quick app that loads on [iPadOS 17.0.3](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/tree/main/mobile/samantha) that test the build in TTS synthesiser in iOS. While the speed is very very fast, the quality is very middling. Theo P has tested the various always available voices and selected 3 that are particularly good, and Theo F will test tomorrow. I will be looking into any potential methods for obtaining the [higher quality voices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesisvoicequality/enhanced) that Apple has. However, these voices have to be downloaded on device before they can be used. 

2023-10-16 Mon: Downloaded the necessary simulators and application to build the iOS template. Beginning to study Swift/Obj-C (specifically focusing on audio classes that will be utillized). Through discussions with Frank, code refactoring for Discord bot will be done by tomorrow.

2023-10-12 Thu: Set up Jupyter notebook to compare runtimes between PlayHT, Murf, Suno's Bark, and Vocode. Synced with Frank on the code structure of Discord Harmony bot and billing expectations.
