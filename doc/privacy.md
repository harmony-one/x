**Personal Information You Provide to Us Directly**

We may collect personal information that you provide to us.

**User-Generated Inputs and Service-Generated Outputs.** Much of our Services require access to your device’s microphone. When you grant us access to your device’s microphone, our Services may process user-generated inputs, including audio content that you choose to make available via the Services. As part of this, we may collect prompts from the voice inputs. We also collect outputs that the Service generate in response to the voice inputs. For clarity, we may record and transcribe your conversations with the Services including both your inputs and the Services-generated outputs.

**Your Communications with Us.** We may collect personal information, such as your name and email address when you contact us.

**Personal Information Collected Automatically**

We may collect personal information automatically when you use the Services.

**Automatic Collection of Personal Information.** We may collect certain personal information automatically when you use the Services, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, cookie identifiers, other unique identifiers, browser or device information, location information (including approximate location derived from IP address), and Internet service provider.

**Cookie Notice (and Other Technologies).** We, as well as third parties, may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through your use of the Services. 

**Cookies.** Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.

**Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.** A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited, a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
