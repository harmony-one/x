## üöÄ Getting Started

Visit [YakGPT](https://yakgpt.vercel.app) to try it out without installing, or follow these steps to run it locally:

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed on your computer to run YakGPT locally.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or npm or pnpm)
- Any modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yakGPT/YakGPT.git
```

2. Install dependencies, build the bundle and run the server

```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000

Congratulations! üéâ You are now running YakGPT locally on your machine.

## üîë API Key Configuration

To utilize YakGPT, you'll need to acquire an API key for OpenAI. The app should prompt you to insert you key.

### Add to .env.local(‚ö†Ô∏è Local use only)

If you want the keys to persist across app builds, you can add it to the .env.local.

```
$ echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-open-ai-key-here>" > .env.local
$ echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_11LABS_API_KEY=<your-eleven-labs-key-here>" >> .env.local
```

## üê≥ Docker

To use the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub (only for amd64), run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 3000:3000 yakgpt/yakgpt:latest
```

---

To build the Docker image yourself (such as if you're on arm64), run:

```
$ docker build -t yakgpt:latest .
$ docker run -it -p 3000:3000 yakgpt:latest
```

## üé§ Microphone Integration

YakGPT makes chatting a breeze with its microphone integration! Activate your microphone using your browser's permissions, and YakGPT will automatically convert your speech into text.

You can also toggle the mic integration as needed by clicking on the microphone icon in the app.

Remember to use a supported web browser and ensure your microphone is functioning properly.

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy and Security

YakGPT ensures your data privacy and security by letting you use your own API key. Your conversation with YakGPT takes place directly between your browser and OpenAI's GPT-3 API, with no intermediary servers.

## üôå Acknowledgments

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for building such amazing models and making them cheap as chips.
- [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/) just an all-around amazing UI library.
- [opus-media-recorder](https://github.com/kbumsik/opus-media-recorder) A real requirement for me was to be able to walk-and-talk. OpenAI's Whisper API is unable to accept the audio generated by Safari, and so I went back to wav recording which due to lack of compression makes things incredibly slow on mobile networks. `opus-media-recorder` saved my butt by allowing cross-platform compressed audio recording via web worker magic. ü§ó
