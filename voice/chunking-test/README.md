# Chunking Test
Quick app for replicating and testing different chunking amounts for text synthesis. Input an integer and text in the text field, and the play back synthesis will be chunked by the specified integer. This can be used to replicate odd synthesis behaviors or test for optimal parameters. There is default text that can be loaded by tapping the Fill Text button. The voices listed are limited to English voices that are not synthesis voices.
